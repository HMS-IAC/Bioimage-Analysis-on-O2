# Bio-image analysis software

## Welcome!
If you are here, it means you are interested in performing image analysis on O2 with the data you’ve acquired. We have prepared installers specifically for HMS O2 users, featuring heavily utilized image analysis tools. Our goal is to simplify your workflow as much as possible.

To alleviate the hassle of complex installation processes, we have developed bash scripts that manage all necessary dependencies behind the scenes. Installation is straightforward: simply log into O2 and run a single command to install the software you need. After installation, the script generates an executable desktop file for easy software launching. A key advantage of our system is its persistence—any installations or modifications, such as plugins you add, will remain in your local directory even after you log out.

We hope these tools prove useful and significantly enhance both your image analysis capabilities and your scientific discoveries!
